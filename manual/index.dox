 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * This is documentation for project "Remote monitoring of greenhouse quantities (lighting, temperature and humidity)"
 * (from rus. №17-СМУ-24 "Дистанционный мониторинг параметров (освещения, температуры и влажности) в тепличном комплексе")

 * \subsection device_layout Layout
 *
 * Layout of device and <a href="Layout.fzz">fritizing source file</a>

 *
 *
 * \subsection device_connecting Connecting
 *
 * The device uses a 220V power supply and a LAN cable to connect to the network.
 *
 * The **main idea** is that the device must be on the **same local network as the server**
 * that reads the data and displays it on the site. Therefore, it is necessary for the
 * **network engineer** to review the documentation and configure the device based on the environment.
 *
 * To configure your device's network, read the \ref device_config section.
 *
 * For debugging connect COM port, read the \ref device_debugging section.
 *
 *
 * \subsection device_config config.ini
 *
 * `CONFIG.INI` is a file stored on the Arduino Ethernet Shield SD card, which formatted as FAT16 and using 8.3 file naming convention.
 * So, you should use a file name with 8 letters in the main part and 3 in the extension, not counting the dot.
 *
 * Also, delete comments from the file, because firmware.ino allocate block for it once.
 * ```ini
 * ;; This is section for configure network state of Ethernet Shield
 * [network]
 * MAC = 00:b0:5a:85:6b:00
 * ;; [!] firmware.ino don't use SSL.
 * ;; I stronly advise you to use a local IP address without access from the external network.
 * IP = 192.168.1.63
 * DNS = 192.168.0.19
 * GATEWAY = 0.0.0.1
 * SUBNET = 255.255.252.0
 * ```
 *
 *
 * \subsection device_led LED Indication
 *
 * LED installed on board for indicate state of device.
 *
 * - On/Off: Device enabled/disabled
 * - Quick blink: HTTP Request was handled
 * - 2s delay blinking: Hardware errors, e.g. SD card not found, sensors not found
 * - 0.5s delay: Sofware errors, e.g. Can't find config.ini file, Failed to allocate memory
 *
 *
 * \subsection device_debugging Debugging
 *
 * For debugging purpose production version of firmware sending messages on COM port.
 *
 * The are 2 types of messages:
 * - Info, e.g. `Info: Client available, quantities scanning...`
 * - Error, e.g. `Error: Failed to allocate memory!`
 *
 *
 * \section api_sec API
 *
 * Server configuration defined by #g_Server variable, by default server listen `80` port.
 *
 * The server responed to all requests with JSON, stored quantities about greenhouse. See \ref api_schema section.
 *
 *
 * \subsection api_schema Schema
 *
 * Quantities aliases:
 * - H - Humidity
 * - T - Temperature
 * - L - Lighting
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *  "H": 50.0,
 *  "T": 22.50,
 *  "L": 487.00
 * }
 * ```
